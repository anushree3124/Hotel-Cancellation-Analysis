# Hotel-Cancellation-Analysis
Hello everyone, I am extremely excited to share my another analysis project presentation on '𝐇𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐥 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬'.



𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐭 : Hotel booking dataset contains 119390 observations for a city hotel and a Resort Hotel between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017 consist of 32 key columns including cancelled and not cancelled bookings .



You would like to ask : 𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐡 𝐯𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐡𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐥?



Here are the Findings :

•Out of 117k bookings, 37% were canceled, leaving 63% active, yet 37% faced cancellations.

•There is some correlation between ADR and cancellations by month, but it's not a direct one-to-one relationship.

•January had the highest number of cancellations (6,031).

•In city hotels, nearly 58% of reservations remained active, but the 42% cancellations significantly affected the hotel's revenue.

•In resort hotels , 28.08% are marked as "Cancelled," while the remaining 71.92% are not canceled.

•Portugal (PRT) has the highest number of cancellations.

•Many cancellations come from bookings made through travel agencies.

•The "Online TA" market segment has the highest number of cancellations.

•The "Transient" customer type has the highest number of cancellations.

•Many guests who had no previous cancellations still canceled their bookings, indicating that factors other than past behavior also influence cancellations.
